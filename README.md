<p>ðŸš€ Excited to Share My First Step in Full Stack Development!

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve started learning Full Stack Development with Route!

 As part of my journey, Iâ€™ve just built my first responsive web page using HTML and CSS only.

The main objective of this project was to understand the core elements of HTML â€” such as headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.), paragraphs (p), tables, divs, and how to properly handle images within a webpage. I also explored how different display properties (block, inline, inline-block) affect layout and structure.

Once the HTML foundation was ready, I used CSS to style and structure the page. The primary property I focused on was float, which I used to position and control elements effectively. I also ensured that the design is fully responsive across different devices â€” laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

This project marks an exciting beginning to my journey into web development, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more and building even better projects ahead! ðŸ’»âœ¨</p>
